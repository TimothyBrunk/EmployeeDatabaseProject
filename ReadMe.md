With a few individual projects under my belt, this was the first one where I felt like I had a good grasp for what was happening. 
This project was built in Java, Spring MVC and SQL. The goal was to load in a database of employees and be able to add, delete and 
edit individual employees' information. This was also the first project where I began to use Bootstrap CSS design. This individual 
project had a four day deadline coming on the heals of learning SQL and JDBC.
