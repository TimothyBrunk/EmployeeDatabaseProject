         			My grades: <br>
         			HTML/JSP: I would give myself a 3 - Meeting <br> 
         			CSS: I would give myself a 3 - Meeting <br> 
         			MVC: I would give myself a 3 - Meeting - due to the fact that the I believe that the controller logic is as concise as I know how to make it. <br>
         			I definitely know that I have a lot to learn, but at this point I feel that I understand the controller and I know what I need to do to use it correctly. <br> 
         			Even though it might not look perfect now, I believe that with more time I would have been able to make it more precise. <br> 
         			JSTL: I would give myself a 2 - Approaching - due to the fact that I think I only used JSTL once or twice. <br>
         			SQL: I would give myself a 3 - Meeting - because I did use Metadata with one query and used SQL language with all of my data manipulation. <br>
         			JDBC: I would give myself a 3 - Meeting - because I believe I have JDBC configured correctly. <br> 
         			Completion: I would give myself a 2 - Approaching - because I believe that I am getting close to MVP functionality with this project. <br> 
         			Aesthetic: I'll give myself a 4 - Exceeding - Because I did put a lot of time in trying to make the site look nice and consistent. There is still a lot of work I could have done, <br> 
         			but, this was a big step in front-end design for me. <br> 
         			Object-Oriented-Programming: I would give myself a 3 - Meeting - Because I used objects most of the time to pass information around. I still have a lot to learn and implement, but I think  
         			that as of this project OO really started to click.
